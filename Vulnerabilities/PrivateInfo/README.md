The android app here demonstrates the need for awareness as to how your personal info is handled across the internet. Any details that you will save in an application may appear elsewhere if you have not read the terms of use or what the application may do with your data. In this particular example, information that you enter in the application will be submitted to the server that the app has set.

Instructions For use
1. Use Android Studio to run application with min API level 27

2. Hit play button in Android studio to start the application.

3. Enter details that you would want to add in the application and press the save button.

4. Enter the URL in a web browser that appears on your emulator or device. Alternatively click the link to open up a browser. The link should look look like the following. [http://vm-007.casci.rit.edu:3000/?id=<unique_id>](http://vm-007.casci.rit.edu:3000/?id=<unique_id>)

5. You can see the data sent on the webpage you just visited.


This example acknowlegdes that it is necessary to be cautious while sharing the sensitive data with the apps we use. It is very easy for the apps to share information with third parties, which could be private info. Apps might share your data with other groups that you may not want to have this information, or could even have this information stolen.
